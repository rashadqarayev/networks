Absolutely, let me explain **everything in a more detailed and beginner-friendly way**, with examples so it actually makes sense.

## 📘 Lecture 6 – **Threads, Concurrency & Thread Scheduling**

### 🧠 1. **What is a Thread?**

A **thread** is like a mini-program running inside a bigger program (**process**).

* **Process** = a program like Chrome or Zoom.
* **Thread** = smaller task inside that process, like downloading a file or playing audio.

#### 🔁 Example:

Imagine a web browser:

* One **thread** loads the images.
* Another **thread** loads the text.
* Another plays music from a tab.

So all tasks can happen **at the same time** (concurrently).

---

### ⚖️ 2. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**

| Concept         | Meaning                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Concurrency** | Handling multiple tasks at once (may take turns) |
| **Parallelism** | Running multiple tasks at the same exact time    |

#### 🔁 Example:

* Concurrency = One cashier handling multiple customers by quickly switching.
* Parallelism = Multiple cashiers each handling one customer at the same time.

---

### 💡 3. **Why use Threads?**

* **Faster** than processes (less memory needed).
* **Can run while another is waiting** (e.g., one thread waits for the internet, another continues working).
* Threads **share memory** so they can talk to each other easily.

---

### 🧵 4. **Concurrency Models (Server Design)**

#### ✅ Sequential Server:

* Only one thread. Handles one request at a time.
* ✅ Easy to build ❌ Slow when many users.

#### ✅ Multi-threaded Server (Thread per request):

* Each request gets its own thread.
* ✅ Fast for many users ❌ Too many threads = slow down

#### ✅ Thread Pool:

* You pre-create 10–20 threads and reuse them.
* ✅ No creation cost every time ❌ Need to guess the right number of threads.

#### ✅ Asynchronous Event Loop:

* One thread only, uses `async` calls to do many things "at once".
* ✅ Great for single-core machines ❌ Complex coding

#### ✅ Process Pool:

* Like thread pool, but with processes.
* ✅ Good isolation (one crash doesn’t affect others) ❌ More memory usage

---

### 🧠 5. **Thread Scheduling**

#### 🧍 User-level Threads:

* Controlled by a library, not the OS.
* ✅ Super fast ❌ Can’t run on multiple CPUs at once.

#### 🖥️ Kernel-level Threads:

* Controlled by the Operating System.
* ✅ Can run on different CPUs (parallel) ❌ More overhead (uses more time/resources)

---

## 📙 Lecture 7 – **Multiprocessor & Distributed Scheduling**

### 🖥️ 1. **Multiprocessor Scheduling**

#### 🪪 Central Queue:

* All CPUs take tasks from one big shared list.
* ❌ Locking issues, slow when many CPUs

#### 🧺 Distributed Queues:

* Each CPU has its own task list.
* ✅ Better cache usage, faster ❌ Needs balancing (one CPU may get too much work)

---

### 🔁 2. **Gang Scheduling**

* If a program has multiple threads that talk to each other, they should be run at the same time on different CPUs.
* ✅ Reduces waiting time

#### 🔁 Example:

* Chat app has 3 threads:

  * One sends a message
  * One receives
  * One stores history
    If they don’t run together, sending thread may wait forever for the others.

---

### 🌐 3. **Distributed Scheduling**

Used when you have a network of computers (e.g., in a lab or data center).

#### 🔄 Sender-Initiated:

* Busy machine sends tasks to free ones.

#### 🔄 Receiver-Initiated:

* Idle machine asks others for tasks.

#### 🔄 Symmetric:

* Machines can be both senders and receivers.

---

### 🧪 4. **Case Studies**

* **V-System**: Keeps a list of least busy machines.
* **Sprite**: If user leaves their computer, it runs other people's jobs.
* **Condor**: Used in universities to run big jobs when computers are idle.
* **Volunteer Computing**: Like SETI\@Home — people donate their computers to run scientific jobs.

## 📗 Lecture 8 – **Virtualization**

### 🧠 What is Virtualization?

It’s like running one computer inside another.

#### 💻 Example:

* Your Windows computer runs a **Linux** operating system inside a **virtual machine (VM)**.

---

### 🧱 Types of Virtualization

#### 🧬 Emulation:

* Simulates another type of computer.
* ❌ Very slow

#### 🖥️ Full Virtualization:

* Unmodified OS runs as if it were on real hardware.
* ✅ Easy to use ❌ Some performance loss

#### 🧩 Paravirtualization:

* OS is modified to talk to VM using **hypercalls**.
* ✅ Faster ❌ Needs special OS

#### 📦 OS-level (Containers):

* Runs apps in isolated "containers", but all use the same OS.
* Example: Docker

---

### 🧙 Hypervisors

| Type       | Description               | Example                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Type 1** | Runs directly on hardware | VMware ESXi, Hyper-V           |
| **Type 2** | Runs on top of OS         | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation |

#### 🧠 Example:

* **Type 1**: Like installing VM software into a fresh PC.
* **Type 2**: Like running VirtualBox inside your Windows to launch Ubuntu.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works (With CPU Help)

* **Ring 0** = kernel (OS)
* **Ring 3** = user apps
* VMs "think" they're running in Ring 0, but the hypervisor actually handles those sensitive tasks.
